# Test_repo# FastAPI Application Unit Testing

This document provides information on a unit testing code written in Python for a FastAPI application.

## Purpose of the Test Class

The purpose of the  class is to perform unit testing on the FastAPI application's endpoints.

## Test Cases & Their Purpose

The  class contains two test methods:  and .

- 

    This test case sends a GET request to the root (/) of the application and asserts two things.
    - Verifies that the response status code is 200, ensuring that the GET request to this endpoint was successful.
    - Confirm that the returned JSON response includes current_time, ensuring that the functionality of this endpoint is working as expected.

    Example Code:
    

- 

    This test case tests the performance of the GET request to the root (/) of the application.
    - It tracks the time taken to get a response from the endpoint.
    - Verify it is less than 0.200 seconds, thereby ensuring the application's speed and performance. 

    Example Code:
     

If any test case fails, it indicates that there is something wrong with the corresponding part of the application. Thus, these tests help in maintaining the robustness of the FastAPI application.
# Unit Test for FastAPI Root Endpoint

## Purpose

This unit test checks the functionality of the root () endpoint of a FastAPI application. The primary purpose of the test is to evaluate if the root endpoint is working correctly and is able to provide expected responses. 

## Details

The test is performed by making a GET request to the root route (/) of the app. After making the call, it checks for two things:

1. The response status code returned by the request must be 200, indicating the request was successful.
2. The response JSON must contain the key . 

The presence of this key in the returned JSON can be seen as validation that the functionality attached to the root endpoint (e.g., returning the current time) is operating as designed.

## Example Code



To run this test, you might use command-line instructions such as , or whatever is appropriate for your specific testing setup.

In respect to achieving a high level of code coverage in testing, this test ensures that the root endpoint of your FastAPI application behaves as expected when receiving a GET request.
