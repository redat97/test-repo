# Test_repo# FastAPI Application Unit Testing

This document provides information on a unit testing code written in Python for a FastAPI application.

## Purpose of the Test Class

The purpose of the  class is to perform unit testing on the FastAPI application's endpoints.

## Test Cases & Their Purpose

The  class contains two test methods:  and .

-

    This test case sends a GET request to the root (/) of the application and asserts two things.
    - Verifies that the response status code is 200, ensuring that the GET request to this endpoint was successful.
    - Confirm that the returned JSON response includes current_time, ensuring that the functionality of this endpoint is working as expected.

    Example Code:

# Test Documentation

## TestFastAPIApp

### test_read_root
- Purpose: To test if the root endpoint (/) returns a 200 status code and contains the current_time key in the response json.
- Steps:
  1. Send a GET request to the root endpoint (/).
  2. Check if the response status code is 200.
  3. Check if the response json contains the key current_time.

### test_query_performance
- Purpose: To test the performance of the root endpoint (/) by measuring the elapsed time of the request.
- Steps:
  1. Start the timer.
  2. Send a GET request to the root endpoint (/).
  3. Check if the response status code is 200.
  4. Calculate the elapsed time by subtracting the start time from the current time.
  5. Check if the elapsed time is less than 0.200 seconds.
