# Test_repo# FastAPI Application Unit Testing

This document provides information on a unit testing code written in Python for a FastAPI application.

## Purpose of the Test Class

The purpose of the  class is to perform unit testing on the FastAPI application's endpoints.

## Test Cases & Their Purpose

The  class contains two test methods:  and .

- 

    This test case sends a GET request to the root (/) of the application and asserts two things.
    - Verifies that the response status code is 200, ensuring that the GET request to this endpoint was successful.
    - Confirm that the returned JSON response includes current_time, ensuring that the functionality of this endpoint is working as expected.

    Example Code:
    

- 

    This test case tests the performance of the GET request to the root (/) of the application.
    - It tracks the time taken to get a response from the endpoint.
    - Verify it is less than 0.200 seconds, thereby ensuring the application's speed and performance. 

    Example Code:
     

If any test case fails, it indicates that there is something wrong with the corresponding part of the application. Thus, these tests help in maintaining the robustness of the FastAPI application.
